# Customer Segmentation

## Project Overview

The **Customer Segmentation** project leverages machine learning to identify distinct groups within a customer base. Customer segmentation helps businesses tailor their marketing strategies, optimize customer experiences, and drive targeted engagement by understanding the unique characteristics of different customer groups. This project applies clustering techniques to classify customers based on selected features.

## Libraries Used

- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data loading, manipulation, and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For visualizing data distributions and clustering results.
- **Scikit-Learn (KMeans)**: For performing the K-Means clustering algorithm.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration and Visualization**:
  - Visualizes customer data using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** to identify patterns and insights.
  
- **Customer Segmentation Using K-Means**:
  - Applies **K-Means clustering** to divide customers into distinct groups based on attributes like spending behavior, age, and location.
  - Determines the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.

- **Cluster Analysis**:
  - Analyzes the characteristics of each segment to inform business decisions.
  - Provides visual representations of clusters to illustrate group separation.
